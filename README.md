# AdventOfCode2022

Fun little challenge posed by my partner. Daily coding challenge with a Christmas theme.

You can find the advent calendar here: https://adventofcode.com/2022

If I'm able to solve the coding challenge then I'm allowed to eat the corresponding day's chocolate in a real advent calendar.
